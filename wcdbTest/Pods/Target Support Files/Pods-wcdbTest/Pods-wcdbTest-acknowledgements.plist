combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution

as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor 
be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of

be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, 
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
Â 
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object 
form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
Â 
a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
License; and
Â 
b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and
Â 
c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, 
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of 
the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
Works; and
Â 
d) If the Work includes a âNOTICEâ text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain 
to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within 
a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices 
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text 
from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
as modifying the License. 
Â 
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License. 
Â 
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under 
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such 
Contributions.
Â 
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.
Â 
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 
âAS ISâ BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
Â 
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such 
as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor 
be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and 
on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree 
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or 
additional liability.
